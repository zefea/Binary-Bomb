# Binary-Bomb

//Explanation for phase 4-5-6 will be ready soon...

The purpose of this project is to become more familiar with machine level programming.

A binary bomb is a program that consists of a sequence of phases.

- Each phase expects you to type a particular string on stdin. If you type the correct string, then the phase is  
defused and the bomb proceeds to the next phase. Otherwise, the bomb explodes by printing "BOOM!!!" and then
terminating. The bomb is defused when every phase has been defused.

- Bomb is a Linux binary executable file that has been compiled from a C program.

  The GNU debugger, this is a command line debugger tool available on virtually every platform. You can trace
  through a program line by line, examine memory and registers, look at both the source code and assembly code.

In this project gdb debugger is used. First command on the window is gdb bomb.And when we run it, we are in.
First lets look at the inside of .exe file.

objdumb -d bomb, objdumb -t bomb will give lots of information about the code. All the function names and lots of it is in it.
Also strings bomb command can work to understand the code. For example here is a part of the result.

...... ~/Desktop/Project 2$ strings bomb
.
.
argv
phase_1
phase_2
phase_3
phase_4
phase_5
phase_6
_IO_backup_base
argc
main
_IO_write_base
crtstuff.c
.
.
.

so with all of the strings, we can see that,
There is 6 phases and a secret phase. To find the passwords every phases should be done step by step. 

(gdb) run bomb
Starting program: /home/zeynep/Desktop/Project 2/bomb bomb
Welcome to my fiendish little bomb. You have 6 phases with
which to blow yourself up. Have a nice day!

BOOM!!!
The bomb has blown up.


When the program runs, bomb has blown up immediatly becasuse it needs passwords. 
So using breakpoints, the assembly code of that part can be seen which is the phase that we try to solve at the moment(phase1,..).
